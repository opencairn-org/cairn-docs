# cairn-docs

Documentation for [Cairn](https://github.com/opencairn-org/cairn-core) — the
self-hosted, multi-source activity tracker. Published at
[docs.opencairn.org](https://docs.opencairn.org). Built with
[Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/).

## Prerequisites

Node.js at the version in `.nvmrc` (`nvm use`).

## Install

```bash
npm ci
```

## Local development

```bash
npm start
```

Starts a local dev server with hot reload (default <http://localhost:3000>).

## Build

```bash
npm run build
```

Generates the static site into `build/`. Preview the production build with
`npm run serve`.

## Check

```bash
npm run check
```

Lint, site build, dependency and secret audit, and fleetlint; CI runs the
same. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the tools and git hooks and
[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for how the site is put together.

## Deployment

Deployment is automated: CI builds `build/` on every push and rsyncs it to the
static web host when a `v*` tag is pushed (see `.gitea/workflows/deploy.yml`).
There is no manual `gh-pages` step. The canonical URL is set in `docusaurus.config.js`.
